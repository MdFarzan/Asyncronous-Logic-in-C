Hi Developers,
This is my first project on github. I was trying to make a  asychronous program, so i developed this logic. This program converts decimal numbers to it's equivalent octal and hexadecimal numbers. But it has few drawbacks now, such as it can't handle more then 9 digits, but i promise i will fix it soon. 

Program Controls:
b:	for backspace,
e: 	for exit/quite.

If given .exe file does'nt work please compile it manually with 32bit compiler.

Thank you so much for reading.
Have fun with this logic.

Have any suggestion please contact:

You're best
